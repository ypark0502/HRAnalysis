**Business Task**: This project involved using provided data to calculate a proposed wage increase for non-smoking employees given an insurance budget of $983,221. Additionally, I created an interactive dashboard for HR to understand trends in Absenteeism at work by exploring possible factors including various health indicators like smoking, BMI, and cited reasons for absenteeism.

**Technologies**: SQL Server, Power BI
## Process
* Get an overview of the dataset
* Query the data in SQL to only include desired figures
* Perform calculations to answer business task
* Format results in Power BI
## Recommendations
Recommendations: According to the data, there are 695 non-smoking employees in the database, meaning with a budget of $983,221, there should be a $0.60/hour or $1414.40 annual increase in wages per non-smoking employee.
